# GoFutures
The scope of the project is to create concurrent.futures like similar functionalities in Go.

Currently a concurrency pattern has been added to track if a routine has been finished or not, which can be compared to done() function of future object.

The next goal will be feasibility of making a separate package which will provide the same functionality and can be imported.
